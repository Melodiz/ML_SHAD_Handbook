Greetings! I am a second-year student at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, specializing in Applied Mathematics and Informatics. 

I have embarked on an in-depth study of Machine Learning and decided to compile this [handbook](https://education.yandex.ru/handbook/ml). My hope is that these solutions will be beneficial to others, as I personally encountered challenges in finding accurate answers to the tasks.

I am eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts. Should you have any questions or wish to engage in a discussion, feel free to reach out to me on [Telegram](t.me/Mellodizzz).

Best of luck!
